# 🎵 Music Player (DSA Project)

This is a **C++ based Music Player** developed as part of the *Data Structures and Algorithms* and *Competitive programming*.  
The project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms through a real-world use case of a simple music player.

## 🚀 Features
- Add, play, and manage songs using **doubly linked list**.  
- Support for **stacks** and **queues** to handle music playback history and playlist management.  
- **File handling** to read and write song details for persistence.  
- Interactive console-based user interface.

## 📖 How It Works
1. User can add songs to the player (stored in a linked list).  
2. Songs are played sequentially, with the option to go **next/previous** (linked list traversal).  
3. **Stack** maintains recently played songs.  
4. **Queue** manages upcoming songs in the playlist.  
5. Song data is persisted using **file handling** (`songs.txt`).
